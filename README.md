# Wave Simmers
A simulation and visualization playground for waves in 2D.

## Goals
The goal is to have a interactive playground for simulating waves in 2D space,
to visualize effects like lenses or the double slit experiment. The simulation
should be performant enough to see the experiment unfold during the simulation.
There is a GPU based solver planned, with the help of the WebGPU spec.

## Thanks and Inspiration
I got the inspiration for this kind of simulation from the YouTube channel
[Huygens Optics](https://www.youtube.com/user/huygensoptics).

I also want to thank [Learn Wgpu](https://sotrh.github.io/learn-wgpu/) for the
introduction to WebGPU and the example code.
